  Notes for advanced subprocess handling in Python (asyncio focus): capturing
  output across timeouts and kills, orphaned child processes holding pipes open,
  cancellable communicate() pitfalls for
  stream readers. Use when writing code that spawns, waits for, times out, kills,
  or collects output from subprocesses — installers, CLI wrappers, tool runners,
  background jobs — or when debugging "my subprocess timeout didn't work" and
  "captured output is empty" symptoms.

# python-reliable-subprocess-handling

**Status: working memo, not a guide.** Everything below came from one real
debugging session; treat it as field notes. Verify against your runtime before
relying on it, and expect corrections — some of this is version-sensitive
behavior of asyncio internals, not documented contracts.

## The big trap: `communicate()` loses output when cancelled

`asyncio.subprocess.Process.communicate()` drains both streams into **its own
local buffer** while it runs. If you wrap it in `asyncio.timeout(...)` and the
timeout fires, the cancellation throws that buffer away. The data is gone:

- it was already consumed from the OS pipe into the coroutine's locals;
- after you `kill()` the process, the pipes hit EOF, so any later
  `communicate()` / `read()` returns `b""`.

Symptom we hit: "timeout worked, but the recovered output is empty even though
the installer had clearly printed progress." Confirmed empirically — do not
trust a second `communicate()` after cancellation to recover anything.

**Fix: don't let the drained bytes live inside the cancellable task.** Read in
bounded chunks into a holder you own:

```python
import asyncio
from dataclasses import dataclass, field


@dataclass
class StreamCapture:
    """Drains a stream into owned chunks that survive task cancellation."""

    _chunks: list[bytes] = field(default_factory=list)

    async def drain(self, reader: asyncio.StreamReader) -> None:
        while chunk := await reader.read(1 << 16):
            self._chunks.append(chunk)

    def snapshot(self) -> bytes:
        return b"".join(self._chunks)
```

Chunked reads (not one `read()` until EOF) matter for the same reason: every
chunk is safely in the holder *before* the next `await`, so a cancel mid-way
only loses the one in-flight chunk.

## Second trap: `kill()` is single-PID, and orphans hold pipes open

`process.kill()` terminates only the direct child. If that child spawned its
own children (a CLI wrapper around a node/jvm worker, shell scripts, anything),
those grandchildren usually inherit stdout/stderr — and **a pipe gets EOF only
when every write end is closed**.

Full failure chain we hit:

1. timeout fires, wrapper killed;
2. wrapper's child (a worker binary) survives, still holds the pipe write ends;
3. code awaited the reader tasks to finish → blocked until the orphan finished
   its entire multi-minute download;
4. the "timed out" log line was placed *after* that await → user saw ~minutes
   of silence and concluded the timeout was ignored. It wasn't.

Two lessons:

- **Never gate the timeout report behind cleanup.** Log/announce "timed out"
  immediately; do recovery work after.
- Don't wait for pipe EOF on a killed process tree. Snapshot what you hold and
  cancel the readers.

Proper tree kill is platform-specific and we deliberately skipped it
(revisit if orphaned work ever matters): POSIX `start_new_session=True` +
`os.killpg`, Windows Job Objects or `taskkill /T`, or a psutil tree kill
(`children(recursive=True)` + kill bottom-up — the one cross-platform option).
Cheap partial mitigation: `contextlib.suppress(ProcessLookupError,
PermissionError)` around `kill()` — asyncio raises `ProcessLookupError`
cross-platform when the process was already reaped, and Windows
`TerminateProcess` can surface `PermissionError` (WinError 5) for a
dead-but-unreaped child. Both mean "already gone".

`wait()` is well-behaved though: it survives cancellation and is safe to call
again after a kill.

## Reference pattern: run, capture, timeout, report

Distilled from working code (an auto-installer that downloads a browser
engine). Memo-grade — adjust shapes freely.

```python
import asyncio
import contextlib


def output_tail(*streams: bytes, tail_lines: int = 20) -> str:
    """Last meaningful lines; installer progress bars use \\r, split on those too."""
    text = "\n".join(s.decode(errors="replace").replace("\r", "\n") for s in streams)
    lines = [line.strip() for line in text.splitlines() if line.strip()]
    return "\n".join(lines[-tail_lines:])


async def run_tool_with_capture(argv: list[str], *, timeout_s: float) -> tuple[int | None, bytes, bytes]:
    """Run argv, capture output, enforce a timeout. Never raises for tool failure.

    Returns (returncode, stdout, stderr); returncode is None on timeout.
    """
    captured_out, captured_err = StreamCapture(), StreamCapture()
    readers: list[asyncio.Task[None] | None] = [None, None]
    try:
        process = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(
            *argv,
            stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
            stderr=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
        )
        assert process.stdout is not None and process.stderr is not None  # PIPEs above
        readers[0] = asyncio.create_task(captured_out.drain(process.stdout))
        readers[1] = asyncio.create_task(captured_err.drain(process.stderr))
        timed_out = False
        try:
            async with asyncio.timeout(timeout_s):
                await process.wait()
        except TimeoutError:
            timed_out = True
            with contextlib.suppress(ProcessLookupError, PermissionError):
                process.kill()
            await process.wait()
        # success path: wait() returned, but EOF isn't guaranteed yet if the
        # child spawned grandchildren — drain tasks finish on their own EOF;
        # give them a moment only if you must have the full output on success.
        if not timed_out:
            await asyncio.gather(*(t for t in readers if t is not None))
    except Exception:
        for t in readers:
            if t is not None and not t.done():
                t.cancel()
        raise
    if timed_out:
        for t in readers:
            if t is not None and not t.done():
                t.cancel()  # orphan may still hold write ends; don't wait for EOF
    return process.returncode, captured_out.snapshot(), captured_err.snapshot()
```

Notes on choices, so future-you can re-argue them:

- Cancelled readers on the timeout path: partial output is "output at timeout"
  and good enough; the alternative is waiting for the orphan.
- If the process may spawn pipe-holding children, even the *success* path's
  `gather` can hang on EOF — see the orphan section. Worth a bounded wait
  there if that's your situation.
- Progress bars: `\r`-redrawn bars turn into one giant line. Normalizing `\r` →
  `\n` before tailing makes the output usable in logs and error messages.

## Surfacing captured output

What worked well as UX, keep or adapt:

- **not stream the installer live**; capture silently.
- on failure: full tail into the WARNING log record; last output line appended
  to the user-facing message (`"...install failed (fatal: disk full)"`) — that
  last line is usually the actual reason.
- on success: tail into DEBUG (a durable file log at DEBUG is nice to have).
- on timeout: say "timed out" plus the last captured line, e.g. "downloaded
  55%" — it tells the user it was a download problem, not a tool crash.

## Child-side buffering surprise

A piped child's stdout is block-buffered (Python child: several KB). Progress
prints can sit in the *child's* userspace buffer, and `kill()` destroys it.
When writing your own probe scripts use `print(..., flush=True)`; for
third-party children there's nothing to do except expect gaps in captured
output. Don't mistake this for the cancellation-loss trap above — different
mechanism, similar symptom.

## Testing doubles: honor the reader contract

Two test-double bugs we created and then had to fix — both look like product
bugs when they bite:

- **A fake `StreamReader.read()` that always returns the same payload, never
  `b""`**, combined with a `while chunk := await reader.read(...)` consumer,
  spins forever — and because a plain coroutine returning without an await
  point never yields to the loop, it **starves the entire event loop**. The
  fake must return the payload once, then `b""`.
- **A fake `wait()` that returns without ever yielding** (`async def` but no
  await point inside) means concurrently-created drain tasks never get a loop
  tick before the code snapshots the capture. Real processes always yield;
  fake it with `await asyncio.sleep(0)`.

And a meta-lesson that paid off twice: before trusting asyncio
subprocess/cancellation semantics, write a 15-line probe script with
`asyncio.timeout` + a sleeping child and *watch* what actually happens. Two of
the assumptions above ("second communicate recovers the buffer", "read-after-kill
sees buffered bytes") died in 30 seconds when probed.

## Open questions / not handled yet

- process-tree kill (POSIX killpg / Windows Jobs / psutil) — known gap, see above.
- Windows: the pattern is covered by default-suite real-process tests (the
  Windows CI leg runs them against the Proactor loop, which is the default
  there — no Selector override may ever be installed, or subprocess support
  breaks). macOS has no CI leg; POSIX semantics are assumed identical to
  Linux. Note the *launch* of downloaded browser engines (not this layer) can
  additionally hit macOS Gatekeeper for unsigned builds.
- interleaving of stdout+stderr is lost (captured separately); fine for tails.
- live progress streaming to a UI — deliberately not done; capture-only.
- SIGPIPE behavior when we cancel readers and abandon the pipe: the orphan
  keeps writing into a pipe we stop reading; assumed harmless, unverified.
